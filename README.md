# Portfolio <h1>

This project was created to deliver a brief professional
background, access to future projects, and contact information for potential future employers, colleagues, and businesses. These features are split into three sections: 

- About me
- Portfolio
- Contact 

There is a menu at the top right corner that directs a user to each of these pages using links. These links are easy to use and the website is very simple to navigate. 

This was a great starter project that certainly pointed out what areas I could use more practice. I found the Portfolio section to be the most difficult, not only telling the images where to go but also the headers on top of those images. Positioning and building content sections into divs is something I will focus on improving both in this project and future work. 


I hope to make this project work on different screen types- which is something it lacks now as well as take away any redundant CSS.
